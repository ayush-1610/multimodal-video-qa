# multimodal-video-qa [YouTube Video Q&A System]

LangChain-Powered QnA Application for Interactive Video. This project demonstrates a Python-based application for analyzing YouTube videos using a combination of LangChain, OpenAI, and Whisper. 

**Key Features:**

* **Video Downloading:** Utilizes the `youtube-dl` library to efficiently download YouTube videos.
* **Audio Extraction:** Extracts audio from downloaded videos for subsequent transcription.
* **Whisper Transcription:** Leverages the OpenAI Whisper API for accurate and efficient speech-to-text conversion.
* **Text Processing:** Cleans and preprocesses the generated transcripts for optimal analysis.
* **Vector Database:** Stores the processed transcripts in an in-memory document store (DocArray) for efficient similarity search and retrieval.
* **LangChain Integration:** Leverages LangChain's powerful framework for:
    * **Retrieval QA Chain:** Constructs a chain that combines a document retriever (based on the vector database) with a language model (OpenAI's chat model) to answer user questions.
    * **Embedding Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI embeddings to create vector representations of the transcripts for efficient similarity search.
* **User Interaction:** Enables users to ask questions about the video content in natural language and receive relevant answers from the system.

**Technical Stack:**

* Python
* LangChain
* OpenAI API
* Whisper API
* `youtube-dl`
* DocArray
* NumPy
* pandas (for potential data manipulation)

**This project provides a foundation for building more sophisticated video analysis and information retrieval systems. By combining the power of natural language processing, machine learning, and efficient data storage, we can unlock valuable insights from vast amounts of video content.**
